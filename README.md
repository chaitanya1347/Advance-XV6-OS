The project focuses on enhancing the XV6 kernel, which is highly similar to the Linux kernel, by adding the following functionalities:

-Integrated new system calls into the XV6 OS to enable and disable tracing of various system calls and to retrieve a list of running processes.

-Designed data structures and buffer architecture to facilitate unicast inter-process communication between processes in XV6.

-Leveraged the new system calls to aggregate large datasets through the implementation of a distributed algorithm for multicast communication
